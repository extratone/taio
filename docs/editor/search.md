## Full Text Search

In file explorer, you can search both file name and content, with support for fuzzy matching, case sensitive, and regular expressions.

Search results are beautifully highlighted.

You can also search multiple terms in one query using `space` as delimiters, such as `Markdown plaintext`, it searches for file name or file content that contains both `Markdown` and `plaintext`.

> Full text search automatically searches sub-folders, it takes some time when you have huge amount of files. If you use external folders, make sure to only link necessary files into Taio, otherwise it may have a significant performance drop.

## Open Quickly

With the powerful global search, you can also open files quickly.

When searching for regular expression groups, `$number` can be used to retrieve captured group matches. For instance, if we want to increase all headings by a level.
