# Math Formulas

Taio draws math formulas using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), which you can find on their website for more details, here is just a brief introduction of how to embed math formulas inside Markdown.

## Inline Formulas

Use a single dollar sign `$` to implement an inline formula, E.g. `$y = x * x$`, preview: $y = x * x$.

Note that, inline math is turned off by default since `$` is a commonly used character. To enable it, go `Editor Settings`, `Markdown Options`, enable `Inline Math`.

## Display Formulas

Use two dollar signs `$$` to implement a display formula, E.g. `$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}. $$`, preview: $$x = {-b \pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}. $$
