## Description

Post to a Write.as blog (“collection”) and copy the URL of the result to the clipboard. (Set your auth token and collection slug manually before running.)

## Notes

I've left the two variables users will need to set at install (their Write.as/Snap.as/WriteFreely auth token and the slug of their blog) in such a way that they will need to be set manually. Please feel free to modify this if there's a more optimal method.

For that matter, please feel free to modify this action however you'd like. And thank you for developing Taio!
